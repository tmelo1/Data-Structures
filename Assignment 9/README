Originally, my HashMap started as an ArrayList that used cuckoo hashing to resolve collisions.
I found that it was not worth the effort to resolve the issue with potentially causing
a massive cycle with attempting to insert, so I attempted to use double hashing. However,
double hashing works best with a prime table size, so I switched to an array so I could control
the capacity of the HashMap. But, because calculating the next prime number can be expensive,
I decided to simply use linear probing. This was definitely less efficient, however, for the sake of this assignment,
linear probing still resulted in a decent run time for some of the sample inputs given.
